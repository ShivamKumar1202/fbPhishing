# Facebook Phishing
### Using php to get the user login data from the facebook page and save it to a file.

# NOTE: THIS IS PURELY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE

### The 'index.html' file sends data over to the php script which saves the data to 'data.txt'

### The facebook html page was not created by me. I simply changes the login form's action attribute to my 'test.php' script and the script handes the rest.
